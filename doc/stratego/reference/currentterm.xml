    <title>Strategies and the Current Term</title>

    <para>
      Strategies are the statements and functions of the Stratego
      language. A strategy transforms a term into a new term, or
      fails. The term to which a strategy is applied, is called the
      <emphasis>current term</emphasis>. In the Stratego Shell you can
      see the current term with <command>:show</command>.
    </para>

    <screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> :show
()
<prompt>stratego></prompt></screen>

    <para>
      So, the current term is the empty tuple if you have just started
      the Stratego Shell. At the prompt of the shell you can enter
      strategies. If the strategy succeeds, then the shell will show
      the transformed term, which is now the new current term.
    </para>

    <screen>
<replaceable>current term</replaceable>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> <replaceable>strategy expression</replaceable>
<replaceable>transformed current</replaceable>
<prompt>stratego></prompt></screen>

    <para>
      Strategies can also fail. In that case, the shell will print a
      message and leave the current term untouched:
    </para>

    <screen>
<replaceable>current term</replaceable>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> <replaceable>strategy expression</replaceable>
command failed
<prompt>stratego></prompt> :show
<replaceable>current term</replaceable></screen>
