    <title>Choice</title>

    <para>
      The deterministic choice operator prescribes that the left
      alternative should be tried before the right alternative, and
      that the latter is only used if the first fails. There are
      applications where it is not necessary to define the order of
      the alternatives. In those cases non-deterministic choice can be
      used.
    </para>

    <para>
      The non-deterministic choice operator s1 + s2 chooses one of the
      two strategies s1 or s2 to apply, such that the one it chooses
      succeeds. If both strategies fail, then the choice fails as
      well.
    </para>

    <para>
      Operationally one can imagine the choice operator to first try
      one strategy, and, if that fails, to try the other. The order in
      which this is done is undefined, i.e., arbitrarily chosen by the
      compiler.
