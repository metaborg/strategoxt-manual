    <title>Deterministic choice (left choice)</title>

    <para>
      The left choice or deterministic choice s1 &lt;+ s2 chooses one
      of the trans- formations to apply. That is, s1 is first applied,
      and s2 is only applied if s2 fails. Formally, the left choice
      operator is defined as:
    </para>

    <para>
      A typical application of the deterministic choice operator is to
      declare the priority between rules with overlapping left-hand
      sides.
    </para>

    <para>
      A useful application of &lt;+ in combination with id is the
      reflexive closure of a strategy s. The strategy try(s) tries to
      apply the strategy s, but if that fails, just succeeds using id.

    <para>
      Note that the choice is committed once the left-hand side
      strategy has succeeded, even if the continuation strategy fails.
