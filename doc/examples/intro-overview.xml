  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>

    This tutorial gives an introduction to transformation with
    Stratego/XT by means of a number of examples that show typical
    ways of organizing transformation systems.

    The tutorial is divided into a number of parts, each part
    dedicated to a particular source language. For each language we
    show how to define its syntax, create a pretty-printer, and
    implement a number of transformations. In addition, we show which
    tools to use to generate parsers from syntax definitions, derive
    pretty-printers from syntax definitions, and compile
    transformation programs.

    The source code of the examples can be downloaded as well, such
    that you can repeat the experiments from the tutorial and add your
    own experiments.

  <title>TIL: A Tiny Imperative Language</title>

  <para>
    The <link linkend="tutorial-til">first example</link> in the
    tutorial is a tiny imperative language (TIL), which has assignment
    statements, sequences of statements, and structured control-flow.
  </para>
 
  <para>
    For this simple language we define a complete syntax definition,
    and show how to generate from it a parser, signature, format
    checker, and pretty-print table. Based on these ingredients we
    explain how to create a typical transformation pipeline (without
    any transformations yet).
  </para>

  <para>
    Next we show how to define a number of typical transformations
    such as desugaring, bound variable renaming, interpretation, and
    data-flow transformations.
  </para>

  <title>BibTeX Transformations</title>

  <para>
    BibTeX is a small domain-specific data language for bibliographic
    information. In the <link linkend="tutorial-bibtex">second
    part</link> of this tutorial we show its syntax definition and a
    number of transformations.
