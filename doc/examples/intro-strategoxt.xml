  <title>Introducing Stratego/XT</title>
  
  <para>
    Stratego/XT is a framework for the implementation of transformation
    systems based on structural representations of programs. This structured
    representation avoids the limitations and brittleness found in the
    text-based approaches. 
    
    Stratego/XT consists of two major parts: XT, a component architecture
    and collection of components for basic transformation infrastructure, such
    as parsing and pretty-printing; and Stratego, a strategic term rewriting
    language for implementing new, custom components.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Together, Stratego and XT aim to provide better productivity in the
    development of transformation systems through the use of high-level
    representations, domain-specific languages, and generative
    programming for various aspects of transformation systems: ATerms
    for program representation, SDF for syntax definition and parsing,
    GPP for pretty-printing, Stratego for transformation, XTC for
    transformation tool composition, and the XT tools for the
    generation of intermediate products needed in the construction of
    transformation systems.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The XTC composition system allows the combination of ready-made 
    components found in the XT architecture with new components written
    in Stratego. This makes Stratego/XT a scalable and flexible environment
    for developing stand-alone transformation systems.
