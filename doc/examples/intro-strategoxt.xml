  <title>Introducing Stratego/XT (*)</title>
  
  <para>
    Stratego/XT is a program transformation system. It consists of two
    major parts: XT -- a component architecture and collection of 
    components for basic transformation infrastructure, such as parsing
    and pretty-printing; and Stratego -- a strategic term rewriting language
    for implementing new, custom components.
  </para>

  <para>
    Both the ready-made components of XT and the new components written in
    Stratego can be composed together using the XTC component model. These
    features combine to make Stratege/XT a scalable and flexible environment
    for developing stand-alone transformation systems for many different
    tasks.
