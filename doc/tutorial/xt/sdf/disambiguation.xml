      <title>Follow Restrictions require exact symbols</title>
      <para>
	Abstract is not possible: symbol must occur in the
	production as specified in the follow restriction.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	As opposed to reject productions, where abstraction is
	possible. So, you can abstract over keywords for rejecting
	them as identifiers, but you cannot abstract over a follow
	restriction for keywords.

    <title>Avoid and Prefer Productions</title>
    <para/>
    
    <para>
      In general, we suggest to use prefer and avoid only as a last
      resorts. A disavantage of this method is that you do not
      actually define over which production you actually prefer or
      avoid the current one. The might lead to surprising
      non-ambiguities.
