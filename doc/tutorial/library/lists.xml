  <title>Lists</title>
  
  <section>
  
  <title>Making heads and tails of it</title>

  <para>
    Lists in Stratego are nothing magical, except perhaps for some
    convenient syntactic sugar. As we know, lists are written 
    <code>[1,2,3]</code>, but this is just sugar for the term
    <code>Cons(1,Cons(2,Cons(3,Nil)))</code>. Assume <code>xs</code> is 
    this list. The code <code>[0|xs]</code> will prepend a 0 to it, 
    yielding [0,1,2,3]. Conversely, <code>![0,1,2,3] ; ?[y|ys]</code>
    will bind <code>y</code> to the head of the list, <code>0</code>,
    and <code>ys</code> to the tail of the list, <code>[1,2,3]</code>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The module <code>list</code> contains a lot of convenience f
    unctions for dealing with lists. For example, the strategy 
    <code>elem</code> will check if a given value is in a list. If
    it is, the identity of the list will be returned. 
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> import list
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;elem> (1, [2,3,1,4])
[2,3,1,4]
</screen>
    
  <para>
    Continuing on the above Stratego Shell session, we can exercise
    some of the other strategies:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;length> [1,2,3,4,5]
5
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;last> [5,6,7,8,9]
9
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;reverse> [1,2,3,4,5]
[5,4,3,2,1]
</screen>

  <para>
    There are two strategies for concatenating lists. If the lists
    are given as a tuple, use <code>conc</code>. If you have a list
    of lists, use <code>concat</code>:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;conc> ([1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9])
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;concat> [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</screen>

  <para>
	The sublist of the first <emphasis>n</emphasis> elements can be
	picked out with the <code>take(|n)</code> strategy:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;take(|3)> [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3]
</screen>  

  <para>
    Finally, the <code>fetch(s)</code> strategy can be used to find
    the first element for which <code>s</code> succeeds:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;fetch(?2)> [1,2,3]
2
</screen>  

  <para>
    The Stratego library contains many other convenient functions,
    which are documented in the API documentation.
  </para>

    Sorting
  </title>
  
  <para>
    The list sorting function is called <code>qsort(s)</code>, and
    implements the Quicksort algorithm. The strategy parameter
    <code>s</code> is the comparator function. 
  </para>
  
<screen>  
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;qsort(gt)> [2,3,5,1,9,7]
[9,7,5,3,2,1]

    Associative Lists
  </title>

  <para>
    Stratego also has library support for associative lists, sometimes known
    as assoc lists. There are essentially lists of <code>(key, value)</code>
    pairs, and work like a poor man's hash table. The primary strategy for
    working with these lists is <code>lookup</code>. This strategy looks up
    the first value associated with a particular key, and returns it.
  </para>

<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;lookup> (2, [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c")]) => "b"
</screen>

  <title>
    Pairing Lists
  </title>
  <para>
    The library also contains some useful strategies for 
    combining multiple lists. The <code>cart(s)</code> strategy
    makes a cartesian product of two lists. For each pair,
    the parameter strategy <code>s</code> will be called. In 
    the second case below, each pair will be summed by
    <code>add</code>.
  </para>
  
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;cart(id)> ([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
[(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;cart(add)> ([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
[5,6,7,6,7,8,7,8,9]
</screen>

  <para>
    Two lists can be paired using <code>zip(s)</code>. It takes
    a tuple of two lists, and will successively pick out the head
    of the lists and pair them into a tuple, and apply
    <code>s</code> to the tuple. <code>zip</code> is equivalent
    to <code>zip(id)</code>.
  </para>
  
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;zip> ([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
[(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;zip(add)> ([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
[5,6,7]
</screen>

   <para>
    The inverse function of <code>zip</code> is <code>unzip</code>.
   </para>
   
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;unzip> [(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)]
([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
</screen>

   <para>
     There is also <code>unzip(s)</code> which like <code>unzip</code>
     takes a list of two-element tuples , and applies <code>s</code>
     to each tuple before unzipping them into two lists.
   </para>
  </section>

    Lightweight Sets
  </title>
  <para>
    In Stratego, lightweight sets are implemented as lists. A set differs
    from a list in that a given element (value) can only occur once. The
    strategy <code>nub</code> (also known as <code>make-set</code>)
    can be use to make a list into a set. It will remove duplicate
    elements. The normal functions on sets are provided, among
    them union, intersection, difference and equality:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;nub> [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;union> ([1,2,3],[3,4,5])
[1,2,3,4,5]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;diff> ([1,2,3],[3,4,5])
[1,2]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;isect> ([1,2,3],[3,4,5])
[3]
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;set-eq> ([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
</screen>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Transforming Lists</title>
    
  <para>
	Elementwise transformation of a list is normally done with the
	<code>map(s)</code> strategy. It must be applied to a list. 
	When used, it will apply the strategy <code>s</code> to each
	element in the list, as shown here. 
  </para>
      
<screen>  
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;map(inc)> [1,2,3,4]
[2,3,4,5]
</screen>  

  <para>
    <code>mapconcat(s)</code> is another variant of the
    elementwise strategy application, equivalent to
    <code>map(s) ; concat</code>. It takes a strategy
    <code>s</code> which will be applied to each element.
    The strategy <code>s</code> must always result in a list,
    thus giving a list of lists, which will be concatenated.
    A slightly more convoluted version of the above mapping.
  </para>   	

  <para>
    Both <code>map</code> and <code>mapconcat</code> return
    a list if equal length to the input. If we want to remove
    elements from the list, we can use <code>filter(s)</code>.
    The <code>filter</code> strategy will apply <code>s</code>
    to each element of a list, and keep whichever elements
    it succeeds on:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;filter(?2 ; !6)> [1,2,3,2]
[6,6]
</screen>

<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;mapconcat(\ x -> [ &lt;inc> x ] \)> [1,2,3,4]
</screen>

  <section>
    <title>Folding from the Left and Right</title>
  
  <para>
    List folding is a somewhat flexible technique primarily intended
    for reducing a list of elements to a single value. Think of it
    as applying an operator between any two elements in the list,
    e.g. going from <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> to the result of
    <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4</code>. If the operator is not commutative,
    that is <code>x &lt;op> y</code> is not the same as 
    <code>y &lt;op> x</code>, folding from the left will not be
    the same as folding from the right, hence the need for both
    <code>foldl</code> and <code>foldr</code>. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The <code>foldr(init, oper)</code> strategy takes a list of
    elements and starts folding them from the right. It starts
    after the rightmost element of the list. This means that
    if we use the <code>+</code> operator with 
    <code>foldr</code> on the list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code>,
    we get the expression <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + </code>, which
    obviously has a dangling <code>+</code>. The strategy
    argument <code>init</code> is used to supply the missing
    argument on the right hand side of the last plus. If the
    <code>init</code> supplied is <code>id</code>, 
    <code>[]</code> will be supplied by default. We can see
    this from the this trial run:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;foldr>(id, debug)
(4,[])
(3,(4,[]))
(2,(3,(4,[])))
(1,(2,(3,(4,[]))))
(1,(2,(3,(4,[]))))
</screen>

  <para>
    With this in mind, it should be obvious how we can sum a list
    of numbers using <code>foldr</code>:
  </para>
<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;foldr(!0, add)> [1,2,3,4]
10
</screen>      

  <para>
   The related strategy <code>foldl(s)</code> works similarly to
   <code>foldr</code>. It takes a two-element tuple with a list
   and a single element, i.e. <code>([x | xs], elem)</code>. The
   folding will start in the left end of the list. The first
   application is <code>s</code> on <code>(elem, x)</code>, as
   we can see from the following trial run:
  </para>

<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;foldl(debug)> ([1,2,3,4], 0)
(1,0)
(2,(1,0))
(3,(2,(1,0)))
(4,(3,(2,(1,0))))
(4,(3,(2,(1,0))))
</screen>

  <para>
    Again, summing the elements of the list is be pretty easy:
  </para>

<screen>
<prompt>stratego></prompt> &lt;foldl(add)> ([1,2,3,4], 0)
10
</screen>
