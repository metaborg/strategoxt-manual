      Concrete syntax

      The representation of programs and program fragments as terms
      entails an abstraction from the representation used by
      programmers. This distance between concrete program notation and
      abstract term representation can make it difficult to understand
      and produce specifications of program transformations. Chapter
      XXX shows how concrete syntax can be used for the specification
      of transformation rules, while still using the underlying
      abstract syntax for performing the transformations.
