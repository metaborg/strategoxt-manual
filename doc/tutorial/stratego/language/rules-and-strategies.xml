  <title>Rules and Strategies (*)</title>

<para>

  In the previous chapter we saw that pure term rewriting is not
  adequate for term rewriting because of the lack of control over the
  application of rules. 

  Attempts to encoding such control within the pure rewriting paradigm
  lead to functionalized control by means of extra rules and
  constructors at the expense of traversal overhead and at the loss of
  the separation of rules and strategies.

  By selecting the appropriate rules for a transformation and the
  strategy to use in their application, 

  We need a mechanism that provides such control, but maintains the
  separation of rules and strategies and keeps traversal overhead to a
  minimum.

  Such a mechanism should allow strategies parameterized with
  selections from the available rules.
 
</para>

<para>

  Also we saw that many transformation problems can be solved by
  alternative strategies such as a one-pass bottom-up or top-down
  traversal. Others can be solved by selecting the rules that are
  applied in an innermost normalization, rather than all the rules in
  a specification. However, no fixed set of such alternative
  strategies will be sufficient for dealing with all transformation
  problems. 

  Rather than providing one or a few fixed rewriting strategies,
  Stratego allows to <emphasis>compose</emphasis> strategies from
  basic building blocks with a few fundamental operators.

</para>

<para>

  What have we learned about Stratego programs so far?

  In <xref linkend="stratego-terms"/> we saw that signatures are
  needed to declare the format of terms.

  In <xref linkend="running-stratego-programs"/> we saw that programs
  can be divided into modules and should contain a <code>main</code>
  strategy.

  In <xref linkend="stratego-term-rewriting"/> we saw rewrite rules
  and their application by means of the innermost strategy.

  In <xref linkend="stratego-rewriting-strategies"/> we saw that
  programs can also use other strategies, such as <code>topdown</code>
  and <code>bottomup</code>, to control the application of rules.

  Throughout we have been vague about the nature and role of rules and
  strategies.

  In this chapter we will unveil the anatomy of rules and strategy
  definitions in Stratego.

</para>

<section>
  <title>What is a Rule?</title>

<para>

  In <xref linkend="stratego-term-rewriting"/> rewrite rules were
  introduced as transformations that are applied throughout a term by
  the innermost strategy.

  In <xref linkend="stratego-rewriting-strategies"/> we saw that the
  application of rewrite rules can be controlled by other strategies
  as well.

</para>

<para>

  A <emphasis>named rewrite rule</emphasis> is a declaration of the form

<screen>
L : p1 -> p2
</screen>

  where <code>L</code> is the rule name, <code>p1</code> the left-hand
  side term pattern, and <code>p2</code> the right-hand side term
  pattern.

  A rule defines a transformation on terms. 

  A rule can be applied <emphasis>through its name</emphasis> to a term.

  It will transform the term if it matches with <code>p1</code>, and
  will replace the term with <code>p2</code> instantiated with the
  variables bound during the match to <code>p1</code>.

  The application <emphasis>fails</emphasis> if the term does not
  match <code>p1</code>.

</para>

<para>

<screen>
stratego> SwapArgs : Plus(e1,e2) -> Plus(e2,e1)
stratego> !Plus(Var("a"),Int("3"))
stratego> SwapArgs 
Plus(Int("3"),Var("a"))
</screen>

  Note: rule is applied at the <emphasis>root</emphasis> of a term,
  not at one of its subterms.

</para>

<para>

  Later we will see that a rule is nothing more than a syntactical
  convention for a strategy definition.

<section>
  <title>What is a Strategy?</title>

<para>

  Strategies are the central notion in Stratego programs. High time we
  got to know what they are.

  A strategy expression defines a transformation, that is, a partial
  function from terms to terms. 

  A transformation is a function since it maps terms to terms.

  The function is partial since the application of a strategy may
  fail.

  Transformations are <emphasis>functions</emphasis>, and strategy
  expressions often combine transformations into more complex
  transformations. Therefore, they don't have to explicitly mention
  the term they are transforming, the so called `current term'.

<section>
  <title>Strategy Definitions</title>

<para>

  a strategy definition names a strategy expression such that it can
  be invoked at several points in the program

  somewhat of a crossover between a function definition in functional
  programming languages, and a method definition in object-oriented
  programming languages

  the current term is implicit

</para>

<section>
  <title>Simple Strategy Definition and Call</title>

<para>
        
  Given a set of rules and primitives as basic transformations, more
  complex transformations can be composed using a set of strategy
  combinators. For example, if $s_1$ and $s_2$ are two strategy
  expressions, then $(s_1;s_2)$ is a strategy expression as well.
  These combinators are the subject of this and the next two
  chapters. In order to reuse common strategy compositions, they can
  be named and parameterized using strategy definitions. A strategy
  definition of the form

<screen>
<code>$f$($x_1$,...,$x_n$ | $y_1$,..., $y_m$) = $s$</code>
</screen>

  introduces a user-defined operator \verb|f| with $n$ strategy
  arguments and $m$ term arguments. Such a user-defined strategy
  operator can be called as <code>$f$($s_1,...,s_n$|$t_1,...,t_m$)</code>
  by providing it $n$ argument strategies and $m$ argument terms. The
  meaning of such a call is the body $s$ of the definition in which
  the actual arguments have been substituted for the formal arguments.

  Strategy arguments and term arguments can be left out of calls and
  definitions.  That is, a call <code>$f$(|)</code> without strategy and
  term arguments can be written as <code>$f$()</code>, or even just $f$.
  A call <code>$f$($s_1$,..., $s_n$|)</code> without term arguments can be
  written as <code>$f$($s_1$,..., $s_n$)</code> The same holds for
  definitions.

</para>

<para>

  Syntax: f = s 

  Name strategy expression s 

  Syntax: f 

  Invoke (call) named strategy f
  
</para>

stratego> SwapArgs = {e1,e2 :(Plus(e1,e2) -> Plus(e2,e1))} 
stratego> SwapArgs

</screen>

<section>
   <title>Parameterized Definitions</title>

<para>
	  
  Parameterized and Recursive Definitions

  Syntax: f (x1,...,xn|y1,...,ym) = s 

  Strategy definition parameterized with strategies (x1,...,xn) and terms (y1,...,ym)

  Note: definitions may be recursive
	
        
  The list of term arguments of a strategy combinator is optional and
  the \texttt{|} can be left out if no term arguments are
  present. Similarly, if the list of strategy arguments is also empty
  the parentheses may be omitted.

</para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Local Definitions</title>

<para>

  Strategy definitions at top-level are visible everywhere.  Sometimes
  it is useful to define a <emphasis>local</emphasis> strategy
  operator.  This can be done using a let expression of the form
  <code>let $d*$ in $s$ end</code>, where $d*$ is a list of
  definitions.

<screen>
let foo = 
 in ... foo ...
end
</screen>

</para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Calling Primitives</title>

<para>

  primitive definitions are used to call strategies implemented in
  another language

<screen>
print(|x) = SSL_print(|x)
</screen>

  The strategy combinators introduced in the next sections are
  impartial to the way atomic transformations are defined.  We could
  just as well use an implementation in a different language, rather
  than a rewrite rule, if that is useful.  Thus, <code>prim("$f$",
  $ss$ | $ts$)</code> represents a call to an <emphasis>external
  primitive function</emphasis> $f$ with strategy arguments $ss$ and
  term arguments $ts$.

  Note that the `current' term $t$ is not passed automatically as
  argument.

  This mechanism allows the incorporation of mundane tasks such as
  arithmetic, I/O, and other tasks not directly related to
  transformation, but necessary for the integration of transformations
  with the other parts of a transformation system. For example, the
  addition of two integer terms is defined via a call to a primitive
  <code>prim("SSL\_addi",x,y)</code>.

  primitive function should take ATerms as arguments

  not possible to use `unboxed' values

  requires writing wrapper function in C
