\section{Generic Definition of Meta-Explode}
	\label{Sec:metaexplode}

	The strategy <code>MetaExplode</code> uses the generic strategy
	<code>alltd</code> to perform a generic traversal over the
	abstract syntax tree of a Stratego module. Anywhere in this
	tree where it finds a <code>ToTerm(\_)</code>, its argument is
	exploded using <code>trm-explode</code>. This latter strategy is
	composed from a number of rules that recognize special
	cases. The general case is handled by <code>TrmOp</code>, which
	decomposes a term into its constructor <code>op</code> and
	arguments <code>ts</code>, and constructs an abstract syntax term
	<code>Op(op,ts')</code>, where the <code>ts'</code> are the exploded
	arguments. The transformation <code>str-explode</code> is similar
	to <code>trm-explode</code>, but transforms embedded abstract
	syntax into strategy expressions.
