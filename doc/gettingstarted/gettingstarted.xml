    Stratego is a modular language for the specification of fully
    automatic program transformation systems based on the paradigm of
    rewriting strategies. The construction of transformation systems
    with Stratego is supported by the XT bundle of transformation
    tools. The Stratego/XT distribution integrates Stratego and XT.
