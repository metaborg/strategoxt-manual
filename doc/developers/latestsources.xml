  <title>Installation from Subversion</title>
  
  <para>
    Distribution (stable and continuous) are available from the
    [[StrategoDownload][download]] section. It is also possible to
    obtain the sources directly from Subversion. This is only useful
    if you want to modify the sources of Stratego/XT and might want to
    commit your changes.

  <section>
    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>
      Installation from Subversion requires some packages from the GNU
      build system. You need:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Autoconf 2.58 or newer (2.57 will not do)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Automake 1.7.9 or newer. Very recent versions (1.9.x) are
	recommended and required if you want to create a distribution</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Libtool 1.5 or newer</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>pkg-config 0.15 or newer</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      Unfortunately, many Linux distributions contain old versions of
      these packages, so please check te versions that are installed
      on your system. Also, check that libtool is installed at the
      same location (prefix) as Automake, otherwise =aclocal= will not
      be able to find the Autoconf macros of Libtool (=libtool.m4=)
    </para>

    <para>
      You now need a baseline to install Stratego/XT from
      Subversion. The latest baseline is available at:
      ftp://ftp.stratego-language.org/pub/stratego/StrategoXT/baseline/latest/strategoxt.tar.gz
    </para>

    <para>
      Follow the [[installation instructions]] for end-users for this
      tarball.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How to checkout</title>

    <para>
      You can do a checkout using the following command:
    </para>

<screen>
  $ svn checkout %SVNSTRATEGOXT%/trunk/StrategoXT
</screen>

    <para>
      Note that your Subversion client has to support SSL
      support. Install Subversion =--with-ssl=.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How to install</title>

    <para>
      To bring the source tree into a state where you can follow the
      [[installation instructions]] you must run the =bootstrap=
      script (see also [[WhyBootstrap][why bootstrap]]).
    </para>

<screen>
  $ ./bootstrap
</screen>

    <para>
      Now you can proceed with the [[installation instructions]] for a
      Stratego/XT distribution, with one exception: you must configure
      Stratego/XT with your baseline installation:
      =--with-strategoxt=$baselineprefix=
    </para>

    <para>
      Historical note: in the past, a separate =make= and =make
      install= was not possible if you were installing for
      Subversion. This is no longer the case: you can use a separate
      and =make= and =make install= now we are using a baseline.
    </para>

    <title>Subversion Repoman</title>

    <para>
      The repoman for gives an overview of possible ways to view the
      sources the StrategoXT repository:
