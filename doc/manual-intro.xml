    Program source code is the raw material produced by the software
    industry. Rather than being an end product, this material requires
    further processing to turn it into useful products. Compilation,
    the translation of a program to machine code in order to make it
    executable, is the standard processing technique applied. But much
    more can be done. There are many other kinds of processes that can
    be applied to programs. For example, programs can be synthesized
    from high-level specifications; programs can be optimized using
    knowledge of the application domain; documentation for
    understanding a program can be automatically derived from its
    sources; programs can be specialized to known inputs; application
    programs can be generated from domain-specific languages;
    low-level programs can be reverse engineered into high-level
    programs.

    All these processes require the manipulation of program source
    code.  In fact, all such manipulations can be viewed as
    transformations of a program to a derived program. (Here the
    notion of `program' is interpreted broadly, and includes all kinds
    of artifacts used in the composition of software systems,
    including configuration and data files, as long as there contents
    conform to some formal language.) Hence, program transformation is
    the unifying notion underlying automatic program processing.

    To reach a higher level of automation in software engineering, the
    use of automatic program transformation is indispensable.
    However, the realization of program transformation systems is
    hard.  Parts of the process, such as parsing, are supported by
    generative techniques, but most aspects require hard work.  The
    effective implementation of program transformation systems is a
    barrier for the wide adoption of program transformation in
    software engineering.  Most transformation techniques used in
    practice are based on textual generation and manipulation, which
    poses limitations on what can be done and is error-prone.

    Stratego/XT is a framework for the implementation of
    transformation systems based on structural representations of
    programs. 

    The framework aims at better productivity in the development of
    transformation systems through the use of high-level
    representations, domain-specific languages, and generative
    programming for various aspects of transformation systems: ATerms
    for program representation, SDF for syntax definition and parsing,
    GPP for pretty-printing, Stratego for transformation, XTC for
    transformation tool composition, and the XT tools for the
    generation of intermediate products needed in the construction of
    transformation systems.

    This book provides a manual to program transformation with
    Stratego/XT 


    This book is complementary to the Stratego/XT tutorial, a book
    that presents several large examples of Stratego/XT programs.

    This chapter gives an overview of the manual.
