        Conventional Term Rewriting

        - Rewrite system = set of rewrite rules

        - Redex = reducible expression

        - Normalization = exhaustive application of rules to term

        - (Stop when no more redices found)

        - Strategy = algorithm used to search for redices

        - Strategy given by engine

     </para>

     <para>

        Strategic Term Rewriting

        - Select rules to use in a specific transformation

        - Select strategy to apply

        - Define your own strategy if necessary

        - Combine strategies

     </para>
