To build this manual, you need the following packages from Nix:

   * docbook-xsl
   * docbook-xml
   * recent libxml2 (2.6.5 works)
   * libxslt
   * jing-tools
   * batik
   * docbook5 (5.0-pre-cr1 works)

You can also build it on a Debian system, by installing

   * docbook-xsl
   * docbook-xml
   * xsltproc

In either case, you will also need a working version of Stratego/XT on 
your system to compile the examples, as part of the manual building.
