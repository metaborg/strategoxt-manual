 TIL - Tiny Imperative Language
================================

This project contains an implementation of a tiny imperative language
called TIL in the Stratego/XT program transformation system. It is meant
as a small and rather clear illustration of how to implement languages.

A fuller explanation of the implementation is available in the 
Stratego/XT development manual, available on-line:
